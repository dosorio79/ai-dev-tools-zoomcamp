# Requirements

This document defines the functional and technical requirements for the coding interview application described in the Module 2 homework.

The application must support creating a collaborative coding environment that multiple users can share and interact with in real time.

---

# ✅ Functional Requirements

## 1. Create and Share a Session Link
- Users must be able to create a new interview session.
- A unique URL is generated for the session.
- Anyone with the link can join — **no authentication required**.

## 2. Collaborative Real-Time Code Editing
Participants must be able to:
- Edit code simultaneously in a shared code editor
- See each other’s changes instantly
- See each other’s cursor movements or selections
- View a list of active participants in the session

Real-time updates must be delivered using **WebSockets**.

## 3. Syntax Highlighting for Multiple Languages
The editor must support syntax highlighting for at least:
- JavaScript
- Python

Switching the language updates the editor mode.

## 4. Safe In-Browser Code Execution
The application must provide a way to run code **without executing anything on the backend**.

- JavaScript execution: sandboxed environment in the browser.
- Python execution: compile and run Python using **WASM** (Pyodide or similar).

The execution result (stdout/error) should be displayed in a run/output panel.

## 5. Participant Presence Tracking
- The UI must show who is currently in the session.
- Users may enter a display name when joining.
- No authentication or persistence is required.

# 🔧 Technical Requirements

## Frontend (React + Vite)
The frontend must:
- Use React (Lovable UI generation is acceptable)
- Include a shared code editor (CodeMirror 6 was generated by Lovable)
- Handle WebSocket connections for real-time behavior
- Provide a UI for:
  - creating sessions
  - joining sessions
  - switching languages
  - running code
  - viewing participants

## Backend (Node.js + Express + WebSockets)
The backend must provide:
- REST API for session creation and retrieval:
  - `POST /session`
  - `GET /session/:id`
- WebSocket server for real-time collaboration:
  - receiving edits and cursor updates
  - broadcasting updates to other users
  - managing join/leave events

## In-Memory Session Storage
- The backend should maintain active sessions in RAM.
- No database is required.
- Data does not need to persist between server restarts.

---

# 📡 Communication Requirements

## REST (HTTP)
- Used only for creating sessions and fetching basic session info.
- No authentication.
- Stateless design.

## WebSocket Messages
At minimum, the system should support:
- `join`
- `code_change`
- `cursor_change`
- `presence_update`
- `language_change` (optional)

---

# 📦 Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Real-time behavior should feel responsive (low-latency WS updates).

### Security
- Backend must never execute user-provided code.
- Execution must happen **only** inside the browser.

### Maintainability
- Organized structure for components, contexts, WS logic, and execution engine.
- Clear separation of concerns between:
  - collaboration logic
  - execution logic
  - UI rendering

### Deployment
- Frontend + backend must run together in a **single Docker container**.
- Deploy to a hosting platform of choice (Render, Railway, Fly.io, etc.).

This document reflects the **exact scope of the module’s homework**, without adding features (auth, database, persistence) that were never requested.
